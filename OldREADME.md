Doki Doki Mod Launcher (DDML) is a mod launcher for Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC) which is designed to help new mod players install their favorite mods without much hassle.

## Features
1. Auto DDLC installation.
2. Auto DDLC mod installation.
    > This will differ from mod to mod due to the lack of standardization. While DDML is able to install most mods just fine, I cannot guarantee that one specific mod will be able to be installed. To report a broken mod install, make a Issue Request in [Issues](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDML/issues) for me to take a look at.
3. Dark mode (based off Samsung's One UI).
4. Mod folder management.
5. Ability to move mods to different folders.
6. Ability to reset the save file of mods.
7. MacOS and Linux Support!
    > While MacOS support is available, I cannot guarantee that the code will translate well to it from `renpy.app`. MacOS testing is done on __x86__; *Apple Silicon* has never been tested. Please report these issues when you get a error.
8. Mod Search Support!
    > Please be advised that this database comes from the now defunct Doki Doki Mod Club. Newer mods released after the site shutdown (such as Exit Music Redux) will not show up in the mod list search.
9. Compatibility with DDMM (Doki Doki Mod Manager)! Transfer your mods easily to DDML using the built-in transfer tool.
    > This feature for now is exclusive to Windows. Wine or AppImages of DDMM will not work as they need more research.
10. Custom theme support!
