# The New DDML 5.0 Version/Historical Repository

Here contains all files for DDML 5.0 which is being worked on ATM. This should fix some bugs, add new features from 4.2.0L. This does not violate any IP Guidelines or Ren'Py as listed in the **README.txt**.

This is a modification of the Ren'Py SDK which should not be used to build mods. It is possible to add a Mod Build later on but for now use it for **ONLY** mods and not building. That's where you get the original SDK.

For the purposes of LGPL compliance, all source code that Ren'Py depends
on is located in one of the following repositories:

* https://github.com/renpy/renpy (Ren'Py)
* https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2 (Pygame_SDL2)
* https://github.com/renpy/renpy-deps (Desktop dependencies)
* https://github.com/renpy/python-for-android (Android)
* https://github.com/renpy/rapt (Android Build Tools)
* https://github.com/renpy/renios (iOS)

This is not a official mod launcher that is supported by Team Salvato for Doki Doki Literature Club. This is not considered a modification of DDLC, only a tool used to install mods.
