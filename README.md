Doki Doki Mod Launcher is a unofficial DDLC mod launcher that is unaffiliated with Team Salvato for Doki Doki Literature Club. This is not considered a modification of DDLC, only a tool used to install mods.

Despite DDML being able to run any other Ren'Py game or Ren'Py mods other than DDLC or DDLC mods, **do not attempt to modify DDML in a way that it can run other Ren'Py game mods without explicit permission by the developer of the game that it can be modded** not due to compatibility, but it can violate any IP Guidelines listed by other developers. Do note that RenpyTom will not provide support for that modification in anyway or the creator of this tool outside of DDLC.
