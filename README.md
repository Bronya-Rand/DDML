# The New DDML 5.0 Version/Historical Repository

**DISCLAIMER**

Doki Doki Mod Launcher, is a Ren'Py 6.99.12.4 SDK Modification which is not affiliated or supported in anyway to RenpyTom. It is not supported by the official Ren'Py Build, or any Ren'Py channels. RenpyTom does not support game modding in general or provide support for game or this Ren'Py Modification, and all liability will be held to the creator of this modification.
    
This is not a official mod launcher that is supported by Team Salvato for Doki Doki Literature Club. This is not considered a modification of DDLC, only a tool used to install mods.

Despite this being able to mod any other Ren'Py game other than DDLC, DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER REN'PY GAME WITH DOKI DOKI MOD LAUNCHER not due to compatibility, but it can violate any IP Guidelines listed by other publishers and YOU will be held liable, NOT THE CREATOR OF THIS MOD, for unauthorized modification or reverse engineering, unless the publisher allows modding. Do note that RenpyTom will not provide support for that modification in anyway or the creator of this tool outside of DDLC.

This is a modification of the Ren'Py SDK which should not be used to build mods. It is possible to add a Mod Build later on but for now use it for **ONLY** mods and not building. That's where you get the original SDK.
