Doki Doki Mod Launcher (DDML) is a mod launcher for Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC) which is designed to help new mod players install their favorite mods without much hassle.

## Features
1. Auto DDLC installation
2. Auto DDLC mod installation
    > This will differ from mod to mod due to the lack of mod ZIP standardization. While DDML is able to install most Ren'Py 6 and 7 mods to your system, I cannot guarantee that one specific mod will be able to be installed. For that, make a Issue Request in [Issues](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDML/issues) for me to take a look at.
3. Dark mode.
4. Mod folder management.
5. Ability to move mods to different folders
6. Ability to reset the save file of mods.
7. MacOS and Linux Support!
    > While MacOS support is available, I cannot guarantee that the same code for Windows and Linux will translate well to the Mac OS version of DDML from `renpy.app`. Please report these issues when you get a error.
8. Mod Search Support!
    > Please be advised this is the last JSON cache from Doki Doki Mod Club. Newer mods released after the site shutdown will not show up in this mod list search.
9. Compatibility with DDMM! Transfer your mods easily to DDML using the built-in transfer tool.
